## GitHub Integration Script

### Purpose

The `script.sh` located in the `integrations/github/` directory is a script intended to fetch GitHub users. **Note:** This script is not recommended for production use due to several issues.

### Usage Instructions

To run the script, navigate to the `integrations/github/` directory and execute the script:

```bash
cd integrations/github
bash script.sh
```

### Warnings and Limitations

- **Hardcoded API Keys:** The script contains hardcoded GitHub API keys, which is a bad practice and poses security risks.
- **Lack of Error Handling:** The script does not handle errors effectively, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Redundant Operations:** The script performs several redundant operations, making it inefficient.
- **No Input Validation:** There is no validation for user input, which can lead to errors.
- **Inefficient File Operations:** The script creates multiple unnecessary files and directories without proper cleanup.
- **No Proper Exit Codes:** The script does not use proper exit codes to indicate success or failure.

### Prerequisites

- Bash shell environment
- Internet connection to access GitHub API
