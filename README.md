## New Functions

### `calculate_average`

Calculates the average of a list of numbers.

**Usage:**
```python
average = calculate_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(f"The average is: {average}")
```

**Parameters:**
- `numbers` (list): A list of numerical values.

**Returns:**
- The average of the numbers in the list.

### `process_data`

Processes a list of data by sorting it.

**Usage:**
```python
sorted_data = process_data([3, 1, 2])
print(sorted_data)
```

**Parameters:**
- `data` (list): A list of data to be sorted.

**Returns:**
- The sorted list of data.

## Known Issues and Limitations

- **Missing Variable Initialization:** Ensure all variables are initialized before use.
- **Incorrect Function Call:** The `sort()` method modifies the list in place and returns `None`. Use `sorted(data)` to return a sorted list.
- **Type Mismatch:** Concatenating a string and an integer will raise a `TypeError`. Convert the integer to a string first.
- **Incorrect List Operation:** The `append()` method takes only one argument. Use `extend()` to add multiple elements.
- **Undefined Variable:** Ensure all variables are defined before use to avoid `NameError`.
