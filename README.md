## Trading System

The code introduces a new trading system with the following components:

### Classes

- **Stock**: Represents a stock with a symbol and price. It includes methods to update the stock price and maintain a price history.
  
- **Portfolio**: Manages the user's financial assets, including balance, holdings, and transaction history. It provides methods to buy and sell stocks.
  
- **TradingSystem**: Manages the overall trading environment, including available stocks and the user's portfolio. It supports adding stocks, starting trading sessions, simulating market movements, executing trades, and saving the portfolio state.

### Methods

- **Stock.update_price(new_price: float)**: Updates the stock's price and records the price history.
  
- **Portfolio.buy(stock: Stock, quantity: int) -> bool**: Buys a specified quantity of a stock if sufficient balance is available.
  
- **Portfolio.sell(stock: Stock, quantity: int) -> bool**: Sells a specified quantity of a stock if sufficient holdings are available.
  
- **TradingSystem.add_stock(symbol: str, initial_price: float)**: Adds a new stock to the trading system.
  
- **TradingSystem.start_trading(initial_balance: float)**: Initializes the portfolio with a starting balance and opens the market for trading.
  
- **TradingSystem.simulate_market_movement()**: Simulates random market movements affecting stock prices.
  
- **TradingSystem.execute_trade(symbol: str, quantity: int, is_buy: bool) -> bool**: Executes a buy or sell trade for a specified stock.
  
- **TradingSystem.get_portfolio_value() -> float**: Calculates the total value of the portfolio, including cash balance and current stock holdings.
  
- **TradingSystem.save_portfolio_state(filename: str)**: Saves the current state of the portfolio to a JSON file.

### Example Usage

```python
def main():
    # Create and initialize trading system
    system = TradingSystem()
    system.add_stock("AAPL", 150.0)
    system.add_stock("GOOGL", 2800.0)
    system.add_stock("MSFT", 300.0)
    
    # Start trading with initial balance
    system.start_trading(10000.0)
    
    # Simulate some trading
    for _ in range(5):
        system.simulate_market_movement()
        system.execute_trade("AAPL", 2, True)
        system.execute_trade("GOOGL", 1, True)
        system.execute_trade("MSFT", 3, True)
    
    # Save portfolio state
    system.save_portfolio_state("portfolio_state.json")
    
    print(f"Final portfolio value: ${system.get_portfolio_value():.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
